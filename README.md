I finished all of these modules from **pwn.college**, but will only demonstrate few examples here. You can check my profile on the [website](https://pwn.college/hacker/1o1).
# Computer Software Introspection

This repository contains a collection of scripts, tools, and methodologies for performing low-level software introspection, reverse engineering, and syscall tracing.

## Tools and Techniques Covered:
- Tracing syscalls and memory operations.
- Analyzing registers and performing linear equations with registers.
- Performing bitwise operations, modulo operations, and stack manipulations.
- Using **GDB**, **ROPgadget**, **objdump**, and **Ghidra** for analysis and reverse engineering.

## Tools:
- **GDB Scripts**: Automate tracing syscalls and memory analysis.
- **ROPgadget**: Discover and analyze gadgets for ROP chains.
- **objdump**: Disassemble and analyze binary code.
- **Ghidra**: Reverse engineer code with advanced analysis tools.

## Examples:
- Sample programs demonstrating syscall tracing, stack manipulation, and more.
